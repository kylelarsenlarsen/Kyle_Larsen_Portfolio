# Kyle Larsen's Portfolio
My motivation behind this project was to get hustling on some projects. It turns out I like to procrastinate, therefore I will be both a sprinter and marathon runner simultaneously. I built this project to give my online portfolio some legs to stand on. I learned how to implement content delivery networks. In this case I used bootstrap.
## Description
I'm certain my use of mark down notation is surpassing my ability to utilize HTML and CSS. That's life, what can you do?
## Usage
It's straightforward. You simply click one of three navigation buttons or scroll, I prefer scrolling, and you have unlocked the mystique of my webpage. Do enjoy, come again, come often, bring a friend. :)
